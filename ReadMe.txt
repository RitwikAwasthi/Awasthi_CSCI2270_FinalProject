My project will be a console text fighting game that will incorporate a graph as a map, and a linked list as a method of storing scores and rankings. The graph will be created with a read me file that consists of city names and will pick a few at random. Each city will be assigned different aspects and variables that will change how you play in that map. There will be a basic AI to fight against in this game. The goal of the game will be to defeat the enemy in all of the cities. Environmental variables will include having a map deal a certain damage every turn as Radiation or Fire etc... Scores will be stored as a linked list that will display all your fights and some stats when you either win or die or quit.
