What is the Project: 

My project is a console text fighting game that incorporates a graph as a map, and a linked list as a method of storing scores and rankings. The graph is created with random city names and enemy names. There is a basic AI to fight against in this game. The goal of the game will be to defeat the enemy in all of the cities. Scores are stored as a linked list that will display the statistics of all your fights when you win or die.


How to run it: 

You can run my project by typing in "g++ -std=c++11 Enemy.cpp Player.cpp main.cpp -o main", and then "./main" into any LINUX terminal. The program has only been tested on CU Virtual Machine running Xubuntu.  


System Requirements: 

run the program on LINUX.
