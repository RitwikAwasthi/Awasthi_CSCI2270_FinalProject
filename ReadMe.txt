What is the Project: 
My project will be a console text fighting game that will incorporate a graph as a map, and a linked list as a method of storing scores and rankings. The graph will be created with random city names and enemy names. There will be a basic AI to fight against in this game. The goal of the game will be to defeat the enemy in all of the cities. Scores will be stored as a linked list that will display all your fights and some stats when you win or die.

How to run it: 
You can run my project by typing in "g++ -std=c++11 Enemy.cpp Player.cpp main.cpp -o main", and then "./main" into any LINUX terminal. The program has only been tested on CU Virtual Machine running Xubuntu.  

System Requirements: 
run the program on LINUX.
